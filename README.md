# Create REST API with Express.js

## Objectives

- Practice different kind of HTTP methods
- Test requests with Postman

## Overview

Looking at your ```app.js``` you will find:
1. Initial setup for your server.
2. A variable called ```memes``` that we will use to apply our REST operations on.

NOTE: Please don't make any changes to the ```memes``` variable.

## Instructions

### Part 0: GET `/memes`

When you call the endpoint `/memes` return all the memes as JSON

### Part 1: POST `/memes`

### Part 2: GET `/memes/:id`

### Part 3: PUT `/memes/:id`

### Part 4: DELETE `/memes/:id`

### Part 5: GET `/memes/filter`
